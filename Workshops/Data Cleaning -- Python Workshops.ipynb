    "Data cleaning is argueably one of the most important skills students of Economics can learn. A lot of people don't realise just how crucial skills such as data cleaning are to answering questions in real life. We have all spent time in our econometrics classes thinking about the ideal way to estimate or test economic phenomena. The reality is that often times the data we work with is not ideal, and we need to work with it to get it into a form with which we can apply those things we have learnt in class."

For example, maybe the dataset displays `University` as `University of Sydney` for some observations but `USYD` for others. This is a problem, because if we want to work with data we need some level of consistency across observations.\n",

We know that these two should be consistent (because of the documentation). Now, we want to make every observation that embarked at `Southampton` to be coded with `S`."
