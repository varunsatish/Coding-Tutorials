    "## A (kind of important) note about indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "We use indexes in order to keep track of data in a convenient fashion. The example most of us will be most familar with is the idea of indexing a variable $x$ with respect to the an individual $i$, this is where we get the $x_i$ notation from, the quantity of $x$ belonging to the $i^{th}$ individual. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can do a similar thing with programming. When we initialise a for loop we need to tell the for loop which objects it must operate on. When I have an initialisation that looks like `for <element> in <list>:`, I am telling the loop that I want to operate on each object within the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say that we have a list that looks like this: `friends = ['Lea', 'Tommy', 'Pat', 'Chris']`. We have seen already that we can 'index' a list, meaning I can draw out the $i^{th}$ element of the list. `friends[1] = 'Tommy'`. Depending on what we are trying to achieve, we may want to iterate over each **object** within the list or we may want to iterate over each **index** within the list. What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose I want to print each element in the list, I can write one piece of code that will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`for name in friends:\n",
    "    print(name) `\n",
    "\n",
    "This is iterating over each object within the list, note that it has nothing to do with the indexes. It simply prints each object. \n",

    "`for i in range(0, len(friends)):\n",

    "    \n",
    "Here, we are not iterating over each object in the list, we are iterating over a set of numbers which we can use to index objects within the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which one to use? It doesn't really matter, it's easier to use the first way, but if some of you are familiar with MATLAB the second way might be a little easier. Also, the second way only works with lists, there are objects in Python which cannot be iterated over, however there are some applications where you might just need to iterate over numbers in order to select variables by their indicies.\n",
